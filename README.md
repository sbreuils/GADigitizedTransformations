# Bijective digitized reflections
This is a C++ implementation of tools to compute digitized reflections using geometric algebra (with [Klein](https://github.com/jeremyong/klein) library and/or [Garamon](https://github.com/vincentnozick/garamon). This is intended to be used for tests of properties of bijective digitized reflections like involutions. It is also super easy to add other digitized transformations.
