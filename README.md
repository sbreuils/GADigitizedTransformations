# Bijective digitized reflections
Implementation of tools to compute digitized reflections using geometric algebra (with [Ganja](https://github.com/enkimute/ganja.js), [Klein](https://github.com/jeremyong/klein) and [Garamon](https://github.com/vincentnozick/garamon)). This is intended to be used to test properties of bijective digitized reflections like involutions. It is also possible to generate all the bijective digitized reflections in 2D and 3D through a brute-force search.
