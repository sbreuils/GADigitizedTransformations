# Bijective digitized reflections
Implementation of tools to compute digitized reflections using geometric algebra (with [Ganja](https://github.com/enkimute/ganja.js), [Klein](https://github.com/jeremyong/klein) and [Garamon](https://github.com/vincentnozick/garamon)). This is intended to be used for tests of properties of bijective digitized reflections like involutions. 
Slides about the approach can be found [here](https://gacv.slides.com/sbreuils/gadigitizedreflectionsandrotations/fullscreen)
