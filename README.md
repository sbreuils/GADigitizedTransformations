# Bijective digitized reflections
This is a C++ implementation of tools to compute digitized reflections using geometric algebra (with Klein library and/or Garamon). This is intended to be used for tests of properties of bijective digitized reflections like involutions. It is also super easy to add other digitized transformations.
